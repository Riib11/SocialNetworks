# To Do

- separate connected components into their own gexf files
- do centrality measurements for each component separately

- color by conferences in papers graph

- debug 0.0 (closeness centrality) centralities

- figure out units in centrality measure from networkx

- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
