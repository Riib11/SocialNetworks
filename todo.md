# To Do

## !!!

- regenerate `author_name => author_s2id` mapping (with finalized data)



## !!

- find authors for high eigenvector group in AuthorsNetwork

## !

- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart) # maybe don't need to do this because I made the pairs matrix
- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
- this would amount to just changing the coloring so that the non-control and control conferences are different colors. (in which graph? i.e. Papers or Authors)
