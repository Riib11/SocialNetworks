# To Do

- color smaller components by gray-scale (measured by node (paper) member count)

- for AuthorsNetwork: make 4 colorings of networks by centrality measurements, use format that separates connected components

- come up with "one-sentence" explanation for each centrality measure

- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
