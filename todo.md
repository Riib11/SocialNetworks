# To Do

- there are a few rogue "venue" values that are pointed out in `papers_network/papesr_network.py` in the definition of `venues` that I added but weren't found among the papers that I looked through (`/systems-papers/sys-papers/`)

- to find conference names, match papers in SS to raw paper titles

- calculate correlations between centralities in AuthorsNetwork (scipy.piersonR, numpy.collf)

- find papers for high eigenvector group in AuthorsNetwork

- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)
- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
- this would amount to just changing the coloring so that the non-control and control conferences are different colors.
