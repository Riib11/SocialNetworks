# To Do

- think about what centrality means, go through each of the measures so far

- explore conn-comps (graph colors top 10ish), and dist of sizes

- correlation between centralities and hindex/i10index/etc.

- think of interesting semantic questions for network

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
