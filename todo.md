# To Do

## !!!

- reproduce graph of conference citations (with new conference names)

- make notes on authors pairs matrix

- look up info on how centralities are used (in data science)

- say something summarizing about
  - what do centrality measures say about authors (noting don't correlate strongly with index values)
  - how related systems conferences are (systemy-like)
  - read paper from Eitan

## !!

- create mapping between semantic scholar author ids and normalized author names (same way as the one I made for papers)
- find authors for high eigenvector group in AuthorsNetwork

## !

- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart) # maybe don't need to do this because I made the pairs matrix
- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
- this would amount to just changing the coloring so that the non-control and control conferences are different colors. (in which graph? i.e. Papers or Authors)
