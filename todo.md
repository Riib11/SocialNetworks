# To Do

- color smaller components by grayscale (size in nodes)
- make 4 colorings of networks by centrality measurements, use format that separates connected components
- convert centrality measures to log-log scale
- do the same for papers network
- come up with "one-sentence" explanation for each centrality measure
- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
