# To Do

- change axis to log scale
- change axis to absolute (degree)
- remove TPU paper (Google), and outline
- think about what centrality means (diff measures)

- explore conn-comps (graph colors top 10~), and dist of sizes
- correlation between centralities and hindex/i10index/etc.
- think of interesting semantic questions for network

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
