# To Do

- don't color centralities for PapersNetwork
- color by conferences in papers graph

- figure out how to handle "journalName" field of SS entries (look at `/data/python/journalNames.txt`)
- figure out how to handle "venue" field of SS entries (look at `/data/python/venues.txt`)


- debug 0.0 (closeness centrality) centralities

- figure out units in centrality measure from networkx


- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
