# To Do

- separate connected components into their own gexf files
- do centrality measurements for each component separately

- come up with "one-sentence" explanation for each centrality measure

- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)

- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
