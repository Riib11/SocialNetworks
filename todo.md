# To Do

## !!!

- measure correlations between centralities with indecies (like H-index, H-index 5y, and npubs, pubs in 2017, how many program committees participates)
- make neat visual graphing for correlations (scatter matrix, correlation plots)

## !!

- look up info on how centralities are used
- find authors for high eigenvector group in AuthorsNetwork

## !
- color pixels by connected component (look this up: stacked bar chart)
- compare to control conferences: SIGIR, KDD, SLE, OOPSLA, PLDI, IDCM, SPAA
- this would amount to just changing the coloring so that the non-control and control conferences are different colors.
